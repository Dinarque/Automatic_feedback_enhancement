*1* 
 """quel est le rôle de ce groupe dans la phrase ? """ is asking about the role of the group "les mers" in the sentence. 

The mistake in the sentence is with the use of the definite article "les" before "mers". The word "mers" is a plural noun, so it should not have the definite article "les" before it. 

The correct sentence should be: "Aussi, ça permet aux mers de communiquer sans satellite."  
 
 
*2* 
 """Preposition"""

The teacher highlighted the word "pour" in the sentence "C’est très bizarre pour une baleine de faire." The preposition "pour" is not the correct choice in this context. 

To express the purpose or reason for an action, we should use the preposition "de" followed by the infinitive verb. Therefore, the correct sentence should be "C’est très bizarre pour une baleine de faire."  
 
 
*3* 
 """Use of the article"""  
 
 
*5* 
 The teacher's comment "anglicisme" refers to the use of an English word or construction in a French sentence. In this case, the mistake is the use of the word "essentielles" which is the French translation of the English word "essential". 

To correct this mistake, you can use the French word "nécessaires" instead of "essentielles". So the corrected sentence would be: "Heureusement, il a saisi les réserves et les nécessaires et les matériels pour communication."  
 
 
*4* 
 """X quel est l'objet de la phrase ? """ is asking for the object of the verb "faire" in the sentence. In this case, the mistake is in the choice of verb. The correct verb to use here is "faire" (to do/make), but it should be followed by a specific action or activity that the whale is doing. For example, you could say "C'est très bizarre pour une baleine de sauter" (It's very strange for a whale to jump). So, the correction would be to replace "faire" with a specific action or activity that the whale is performing.  
 
 
*5* 
 """Anglicisme""" refers to the use of English words or phrases in French. In this case, the word "essentielles" is not the correct translation of "essential" in this context. The correct translation would be "essentiels" (without the extra "les"). So the correct sentence would be: "Heureusement, il a saisi les réserves et les essentiels et les matériels pour la communication."  
 
 
*6* 
 """Anglicisme""" refers to the use of an English word or phrase in a French sentence. In this case, the teacher highlighted the phrase "saisi les" as an anglicism. 

The correct word to use in this context would be "pris" instead of "saisi". Therefore, the correct sentence would be: "Heureusement, il a pris les réserves et les essentielles et les matériels pour communication."  
 
 
*6* 
 """Accord""" refers to a grammatical agreement error. In this case, the error is in the verb form. The correct form of the verb should be "voyageait" instead of "voyageais". The subject of the sentence is "Il" which is singular, so the verb should be in the third person singular form.  
 
 
*7* 
 The teacher's comment is correct. The mistake in the sentence is the combination of the preposition "de" and the definite article "les". In French, when the preposition "de" is followed by the definite article "les", they contract to form the contraction "des". Therefore, instead of saying "de les îles Galápagos", it should be "des îles Galápagos". The same rule applies to the phrase "de les Polynésie française", which should be "de la Polynésie française". 

Corrected sentence: "Il voyageais des îles Galápagos à la Polynésie française quand le bateau a frappé. Pendant ce temps, l’équipage mangeais une pizza."  
 
 
*8* 
 The mistake highlighted by the teacher is a """preposition""" mistake. 

In French, when expressing movement towards a specific place, we use the preposition "vers" instead of "à". Therefore, the correct sentence should be: "Il voyageait des îles Galápagos vers la Polynésie française quand le bateau a frappé pendant ce temps l’équipage mangeait une pizza."  
 
 
*9* 
 "Préposition" is not the correct comment for the highlighted mistake. The mistake in this sentence is with the use of the article. 

The correct sentence should be: "Il voyageait des îles Galápagos à la Polynésie française quand le bateau a frappé pendant ce temps l'équipage mangeait une pizza."

Explanation: 
1. "Les" should be changed to "des" to indicate an unspecified or partitive quantity of the islands. This is because the sentence is referring to the Galápagos Islands in general, not specific islands.
2. "Polynésie française" should be preceded by the definite article "la" to indicate a specific region. 
3. "Mangeais" should be changed to "mangeait" to match the third-person singular subject "l'équipage" (the crew).  
 
 
*10* 
 """accord"""  
 
 
*11* 
 """Object of the sentence"""
The teacher is asking you to identify the object of the sentence. In this case, the verb "a frappé" (struck) is a transitive verb, which means it requires an object. However, the object is missing in your sentence. To correct this, you need to include the object that the boat struck. For example, you could say "le bateau a frappé un rocher" (the boat struck a rock).  
 
 
*12* 
 In the sentence, the teacher highlighted the word "ça" and wrote "quoi?" as a comment. The mistake in this segment is a vocabulary mistake. 

The correct word to use in this context is "cela" instead of "ça". "Cela" is a pronoun that means "this" or "that" and is used to refer to something previously mentioned or to introduce a new idea. 

So, the correct sentence would be: "Il voyageait des îles Galápagos à la Polynésie française quand le bateau a frappé. Pendant ce temps, l’équipage mangeait une pizza."  
 
 
*13* 
 The teacher's comment regarding the preposition is correct. In this case, the correct preposition to use is "en" instead of "une". The correct sentence should be: "Le voilier de Rick Rodriguez est entré en collision avec une baleine." This means "Rick Rodriguez's sailboat collided with a whale."  
 
 
*14* 
 """Subject pronoun agreement"""  
 
 
*15* 
 """préposition"""

The teacher's comment is correct. The mistake in the sentence is the use of the preposition "de" before the word "kilomètres". In this context, the correct preposition to use is "à". 

The correct sentence should be: "Le bateau a coulé à 3000 kilomètres sud-est de Tahiti."  
 
 
*16* 
 """Preposition""" 

The teacher highlighted the use of the wrong preposition in the segment "sud-est de". Instead of using "de", the correct preposition to use in this context is "au". 

The correct sentence should be: "Le bateau a coulé 3000 kilomètres au sud-est de Tahiti."  
 
 
*17* 
 The teacher highlighted the mistake in the segment "le communité". The correct word should be "la communauté". The mistake is a gender agreement error. In French, "communauté" is a feminine noun, so it should be preceded by the feminine article "la" instead of the masculine article "le". Therefore, the correct sentence should be: "Le fabricant de ces appareils a dit que les appareils sont très populaires avec la communauté de marins."  
 
 
*18* 
 """Agreement"""  
 
 
*19* 
 The teacher's comment indicates a mistake in the verb form. Instead of using the verb "était exister," you should use the verb "ont existé." The correct sentence would be: "Les appareils comme ça ont existé pour les marins récréatifs pendant dix ans."  
 
 
*20* 
 The teacher's comment on the segment "avaient eu" is correct. The mistake here is a redundancy in the verb usage. The verb "avoir" (to have) is already implied in the verb "étaient" (were), so there is no need to use it again. Therefore, the correct sentence should be: "Les autres marins dans la zone étaient réussis dans l’effort de recherches parce qu’ils avaient Internet par satellite."  
 
 
*21* 
 """vocabulary: réussis""" 

The teacher's comment is correct. The word "réussis" is not the appropriate translation for "successful" in this context. Instead, you should use the word "efficaces" which means "successful" in the sense of achieving the desired result. Therefore, the correct sentence should be: "Les autres marins dans la zone étaient efficaces dans l'effort de recherches parce qu'ils avaient eu Internet par satellite."  
 
 
*22* 
 The teacher's comment is correct. In this sentence, the adverb "seule" is incorrectly placed after the noun "agences gouvernement." In French, adverbs usually come before the verb or adjective they modify. Therefore, the correct placement would be "seules" before the noun, like this: "Les signaux de détresse ne comptent plus sur les seules agences gouvernementales." This way, the adverb "seules" properly modifies the noun "agences gouvernementales" and indicates that the distress signals rely only on the government agencies.  
 
 
*23* 
 """Accord""" is the correct comment for the highlighted segment """vieux""". The mistake in this sentence is a grammar mistake, specifically an agreement mistake. In French, when using the adjective "vieux" (old) to describe a plural noun, the adjective needs to agree in gender and number with the noun it modifies. Since "gouvernements" is plural and masculine, the correct form of the adjective should be "vieux" without an "s" at the end. Therefore, the correct sentence should be: "Les technologies des gouvernements sont vieux."  
 
 
*24* 
 """angl""" is an abbreviation for "anglicisme" which means that the word used in the sentence is an English word or phrase that is not commonly used in French. The correct French word to use in this sentence is "essentiel" instead of "essential". The word "essentiel" means "essential" in English and is the appropriate word to use in this context.  
 
 
*25* 
 The teacher's comment is related to the use of the article in the phrase "par batterie". The correct phrase should be "avec une batterie" instead of "par batterie". 

The use of the preposition "par" is not appropriate in this context. Instead, we should use the preposition "avec" to indicate that the satellite device is powered "by" or "with" a battery. Therefore, the corrected phrase would be "avec une batterie" which means "with a battery".  
 
 
*26* 
 """Use of the subjunctive"""
The teacher highlighted the use of the passé simple tense in the verb "eût". In this sentence, the subjunctive mood should be used instead of the passé simple. The correct form of the verb should be "eût" in the subjunctive mood. This is because the sentence expresses a hypothetical or uncertain action, and the subjunctive is used to convey this meaning.  
 
 
*27* 
 """vocabulary""" The teacher's comment is correct. The word "frapper" is not the appropriate verb to use in this context. The correct verb to use in this sentence is "heurter" which means "to hit" or "to strike" in the sense of hitting an obstacle or a wall. So the correct sentence would be: "Rodriguez a dit que c’était comme heurter un mur."  
 
 
*28* 
 """Use of the definite article"""

The teacher's comment is about the use of the definite article "un" before the noun "mur" in the sentence. The correct form should be "frapper le mur" instead of "frapper un mur". 

In French, when talking about hitting or striking something, we use the definite article "le" instead of the indefinite article "un". This is because the action of hitting is specific and refers to a particular object, in this case, "the wall" (le mur).

Therefore, the correct sentence should be: "Rodriguez a dit que c’était comme frapper le mur."  
 
 
*29* 
 The teacher's comment """passif ici""" is referring to the use of the passive voice in the sentence. The student used the verb "sauvé" in the passive form, but it should be in the active form.

To correct this, the sentence should be written as: "Rodriguez a écrit dans son iPhone quand il a sauvé « La technologie nous a sauvés.""

Here, the verb "sauvé" is now in the active form, "a sauvés", which agrees with the subject "La technologie" and the object "nous".  
 
 
*30* 
 """preposition""" 

The mistake in this sentence is with the choice of preposition. Instead of using the preposition "de" after "milliers", the correct preposition to use in this context is "de" followed by the definite article "des". 

Therefore, the correct sentence would be: "Son frère était des milliers de kilomètres loin, mais il a commencé les recherches pour retrouver Rodrigues." This translates to "His brother was thousands of kilometers away, but he started the search to find Rodrigues."  
 
 
*31* 
 """temps"""  
 
 
*32* 
 The teacher highlighted the mistake in the use of a linking word for the segment "Tous". 

To correct this, you can use the appropriate linking word "Bien que" instead of "Tous". This will make the sentence grammatically correct and improve its coherence. 

The corrected sentence would be: "Un ami de Rodrigues qui s’appelle Tommy Joyce a dit Bien que les marins veulent aider, ça rend beaucoup plus facile à coordonner et d’aider les plaisanciers en détresse."  
 
 
*33* 
 The teacher's comment is about the agreement between the noun "oceans" and the adjective "mondiale". The correct form should be "océans mondiaux" to match in gender and number. "Océans" is masculine and plural, so the adjective "mondiaux" should also be masculine and plural.  
 
 
*34* 
 The teacher's comment "conjuguer" is correct. The verb "aider" should be conjugated to agree with the subject "les gens qui" in the plural form. Therefore, the correct conjugation should be "qui aident Rodriguez" instead of "qui aider Rodriguez".  
 
 
*35* 
 The teacher's comment "angl + accord" is referring to a grammar mistake in the sentence. The correct form should be "ont discuté comment" instead of "a discuté comment". 

The verb "discuter" is conjugated in the third person plural form "ont discuté" to agree with the subject "les gens". In French, the verb must agree in number and person with the subject of the sentence. 

So the corrected sentence would be: "Les gens qui ont discuté comment les nouvelles technologies satellite, comme Starlink Internet Systèmes, ont amélioré la communication d’urgence pour les marins bloqués en mer et les gens qui essaient de les trouver."  
 
 
*36* 
 "De trouver ils" is incorrect because the word order is not correct. In French, the pronoun "ils" should come before the verb "trouver." Therefore, it should be written as "trouver ils."  
 
 
*37* 
 The teacher's comment is about the form of the verb in the phrase "améliorer la". 

The correct form of the verb in this context should be "avait amélioré" instead of "avait améliorer". 

This is because the verb "améliorer" needs to agree with the subject "les nouvelles technologies satellite", which is plural. Therefore, the past participle "améliorer" should be in its plural form "amélioré". 

So the correct phrase should be "avait amélioré la communication d’urgence".  
 
 
*38* 
 """Auxiliary verb agreement""": The teacher is indicating that there is an error with the agreement of the auxiliary verb in the sentence. In French, the past participle of a reflexive verb agrees in gender and number with the subject. 

In this case, the subject is "la baleine," which is singular and feminine. Therefore, the correct form of the verb should be "s'est percutée" to agree with the subject.
